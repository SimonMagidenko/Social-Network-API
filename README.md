## Description

My tasks on this specific project was to create an MVC model for the backend of a Social Network site. I created models, routes, and controllers using mongoose. I was able to implement technologies such ass MongoDb, Mongoose, ExpressJS, NodeJS, JavaScript, etc to allow for the program to function correctly. I learned how to use mongoose and actually really like it compared to sequelize and MySQL.
